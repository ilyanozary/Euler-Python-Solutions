# Euler-Python-Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the first four Euler problems implemented in Python. Explore this repository to find my solutions to these problems. It's purely for learning and improving programming skills.
## euler-1
The Euler problem asks to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below a given number. In this repository, you can find my implementation of the solution to this problem. It's a simple and efficient approach that calculates the sum using mathematical properties. Feel free to explore the code and learn from it. Happy coding
## euler-2
The Euler problem asks to find the sum of the even-valued Fibonacci terms below a given limit. In this repository, you can find my implementation of an algorithm that efficiently calculates the desired sum by generating the Fibonacci sequence and summing the even terms. The solution utilizes dynamic programming techniques to optimize performance. Feel free to explore the code and learn from it. Happy coding!
## euler-3
The Euler problem asks to find the largest prime factor of a given number. In this repository, you can find my implementation of an efficient algorithm that factors the number and identifies the largest prime factor using trial division. The solution utilizes optimized techniques to handle large numbers and reduce computation time. Feel free to explore the code and learn from it. Happy coding!
